#Couchie

couchie is a minimalist API for accessing Couchbase 2.0 servers from within elixir. It should work for elrangers as well, as elixir code can be called from erlang (since it runs on the erlang vm.)

I'm experimenting with different backends, currently migrating couchie to use libcouchbase via chikita's cberl.

### Example

	$ iex -S mix
	Erlang R16B (erts-5.10.1) [source-05f1189] [64-bit] [smp:8:8] [async-threads:10] [hipe] [kernel-poll:false]

	Compiled lib/couchie.ex
	Generated couchie.app
	Interactive Elixir (0.8.1) - press Ctrl+C to exit (type h() ENTER for help)
	iex(1)> Couchie.start
	:ok
	iex(2)> Couchie.set "test_key", "{\"test_json_key\":\"test_json_value\"}"
	""
	iex(3)> Couchie.get "test_key"
	"{\"test_json_key\":\"test_json_value\"}"
	iex(4)> Couchie.mget ["test_key", "binary key", "atom_key"]
	[{"test_key","{\"test_json_key\":\"test_json_value\"}"},{"binary key","{ \"key\":\"value\"}"},{"atom_key","{ \"key\":\"value\"}"}]
	iex(5)> Couchie.delete "test_key"
	""
	iex(6)> Couchie.get "test_key"
	""

##Current functionality
- Basic commands: Set, Get, Add, Delete, Stats

##Planned functionality
- named connections.
- Support multiple buckets
- Support raw and json encoding of data
- Simple translation from the Couchbase View's REST API to elixir functions, allowing complex queries to be supported.
